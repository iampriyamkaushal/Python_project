## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I add more questions?**
A: Yes! Edit `questions.json` and add new question objects following the existing format.

**Q: Where are scores saved?**
A: Scores are automatically saved to `leaderboard.csv` in the project folder.

**Q: Can I delete the leaderboard?**
A: Yes, from the leaderboard menu, but confirm the action first.

**Q: Does it work offline?**
A: Yes! The entire application works completely offline.

**Q: Can I modify the difficulty levels?**
A: Yes, by editing the questions in `questions.json`.

**Q: Is there a time limit for questions?**
A: No, take your time to answer each question.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Python command not found
**Solution**: Ensure Python is installed and added to PATH. Try `python3` instead of `python`.

### Issue: questions.json not found
**Solution**: Ensure the file is in the same directory as `main.py`.

### Issue: Can't run main.py
**Solution**: Use `python main.py` instead of just `main.py`.

### Issue: No colors in terminal
**Solution**: Your terminal may not support colors. The app will still work fine.
